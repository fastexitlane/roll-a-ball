# Roll-a-Ball
This is a simple rebuild of the official Unity Tutorial ["Roll a Ball"](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial), aiming to demonstrate some basic features of the Unity Game Engine and the editor.

It only uses Unity-internal meshes and does not rely on any 3rd party assets.
